## About The Project

Candu is a hardware device designed to connect to the bike's Computer Area Network (CAN) and offer the rider more control over the bike's behavior.  For instance, to set and lock the Ride Mode (aka Class Mode) of the bike, as well as other possibilities. This makes for a "set it and forget it" experience, with no app or smartphone required.  The Candu is designed to be a small, low cost, and easy to use device that can be mounted to the bike as an accessory that's always on the job, and that customizes the experience to you, letting you focus on the ride.

## Status

The Candu is currently in the design phase. The first prototype is being designed and tested. You can follow along with the progress on the [wiki](https://github.com/blopker/candu/wiki).
