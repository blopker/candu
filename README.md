## About The Project

The Booper is a hardware device designed to talk directly to a bike's BMS (Battery Management System) and change the mode of the bike. This is useful for bikes that don't have a display or a way to change the mode of the bike. The Booper is designed to be a small, low cost, and easy to use device that can be used on model bike.

## Status

The Booper is currently in the design phase. The first prototype is being designed and tested. You can follow along with the progress on the [wiki](https://github.com/blopker/booper/wiki).
